# Airline Data Insights and Analysis

## Business Problem

Our company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft, ranging from small business jets to medium-sized planes. We have been providing high-quality air transportation services for several years, focusing on ensuring a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey for our passengers.

However, we are currently facing significant challenges due to various factors, including:

- **Stricter Environmental Regulations**
- **Higher Flight Taxes**
- **Increased Interest Rates**
- **Rising Fuel Prices**
- **Tight Labor Market Resulting in Increased Labor Costs**

As a result, the company's profitability is under pressure. To address this issue, we aim to analyze our database to find ways to increase our occupancy rate, which can help boost the average profit earned per seat.

## Main Challenges

### a. Stricter Environmental Regulations
- The airline industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint.
- New and stricter environmental laws have led to higher operating costs and limited expansion opportunities.

### b. Higher Flight Taxes
- Governments globally are imposing higher taxes on flights to address environmental concerns and increase revenue.
- These higher taxes raise the cost of flying, potentially reducing demand.

### c. Tight Labor Market Resulting in Increased Labor Costs
- The aviation sector is experiencing a shortage of trained personnel.
- This labor shortage has led to increased labor costs and higher turnover rates, further straining profitability.

## Objectives

### a. Increase Occupancy Rate
- **Objective:** By increasing the occupancy rate, we can boost the average profit earned per seat, mitigating the impact of the challenges we're facing.

### b. Improve Pricing Strategy
- **Objective:** Develop a pricing strategy that accounts for changing market conditions and customer preferences to attract and retain customers.

### c. Enhance Customer Experience
- **Objective:** Provide a seamless and convenient experience for our customers from booking to arrival, differentiating ourselves in a highly competitive industry and increasing customer loyalty.

## Conclusion

The primary goal of this analysis is to identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate on low-performing flights, ultimately leading to enhanced profitability for the airline. By improving our pricing strategy and enhancing the customer experience, we can effectively address the challenges posed by stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, and increased labor costs.
